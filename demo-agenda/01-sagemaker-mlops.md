- Resource optimization suggestions
- Parallel processing recommendations

### 1.3 Model Development and Deployment (2 minutes)

**Demo Command 5: Model Code Generation**
```bash
q chat "Write a Python script for a classification model using scikit-learn that can be deployed to SageMaker"
```

**Expected Q Response:**
- Complete model training script
- SageMaker-compatible code structure
- Deployment-ready configuration

**Demo Command 6: Endpoint Deployment**
```bash
q chat "Help me deploy a model to SageMaker endpoint with auto-scaling configuration"
```

**Expected Q Response:**

- Auto-scaling setup
- Monitoring and alerting configuration

## ðŸŽ¬ Presenter Notes

### Key Points to Emphasize:
1. **Intelligent Code Generation** - Q CLI understands MLOps context
2. **Best Practices Integration** - Automatic inclusion of industry standards
3. **Comprehensive Solutions** - End-to-end pipeline creation
4. **Troubleshooting Capabilities** - Proactive problem identification

### Demo Tips:
- **Show Real-time Generation** - Let audience see Q CLI thinking process
- **Explain Context Awareness** - Highlight how Q understands MLOps terminology
- **Interactive Elements** - Ask audience for specific requirements
- **Error Scenarios** - Show how Q CLI handles troubleshooting

### Transition to Next Section:
"Now that we've seen how Amazon Q CLI can streamline SageMaker MLOps workflows, let's dive deeper into performance optimization and MLOps maturity assessment..."

## ðŸ”§ Technical Setup Required

### Pre-Demo Preparation:
- [ ] SageMaker Studio or notebook instance ready
- [ ] Sample dataset uploaded to S3
- [ ] IAM roles configured for SageMaker
- [ ] CloudWatch dashboard prepared

### Environment Variables:
```bash
export SAGEMAKER_ROLE_ARN="arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT:role/SageMakerExecutionRole"
export S3_BUCKET="your-demo-bucket"
export AWS_REGION="us-east-1"
```

### Backup Commands (if Q CLI is slow):
```bash
# Fallback pipeline creation
aws sagemaker create-pipeline --pipeline-name demo-pipeline --pipeline-definition file://pipeline-definition.json

# Fallback monitoring
aws sagemaker describe-pipeline-execution --pipeline-execution-arn $PIPELINE_EXECUTION_ARN
```

## ðŸ“Š Success Metrics

### Audience Engagement Indicators:
- Questions about specific use cases
- Requests for code explanations
- Interest in implementation details

### Technical Demonstration Success:
- Q CLI responds within 10-15 seconds
- Generated code is syntactically correct
- Explanations are clear and comprehensive

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Takeaways for Audience

1. **Accelerated Development** - Q CLI reduces pipeline creation time by 60-80%
2. **Built-in Best Practices** - Automatic inclusion of MLOps standards
3. **Intelligent Troubleshooting** - Proactive issue identification and resolution
4. **Seamless Integration** - Works with existing SageMaker workflows
